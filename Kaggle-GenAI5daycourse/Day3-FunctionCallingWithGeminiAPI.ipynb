When function schemas are defined and made available to the model and a conversation is started, instead of returning a text response, the model may return a `function_call` instead. When this happens, the client must respond with a `function_response`, indicating the result of the call, and the conversation can continue on as normal.\n\nThis function calling interaction normally happens manually, allowing you, the client, to validate and initiate the call. However the Python SDK also supports **automatic function calling**, where the supplied functions will be automatically invoked. This is a powerful feature and should only be exposed when it is safe to do so, such as when the functions have no [side-effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)).\n\nHere's the state diagram representing the conversation flow with function calling. With automatic function calling, the bottom row is executed automatically by the Python SDK.
