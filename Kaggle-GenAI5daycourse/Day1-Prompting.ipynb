You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

Barnaby, seizing his chance, slipped inside, the smell of cardboard and spices filling his nose. As the truck rumbled down the road, Barnaby felt a surge of excitement. He was on an adventure!\n\nHe found himself in a bustling market, a cacophony of smells and sounds. He squeezed under a stall selling exotic fruits, the scent of mango and papaya intoxicating him. A woman with bright blue eyes spotted him, her laughter ringing out as she offered him a juicy piece of pineapple. Barnaby devoured it, his tail swishing with contentment.\n\nThe market was a playground. He chased pigeons, batted at a stray feather, and even made friends with a grumpy but ultimately kind-hearted dachshund. He learned to navigate the crowded streets, dodging feet and shopping bags with practiced ease. \n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple, Barnaby knew it was time to head home. The adventure, however, had changed him. He was no longer just Barnaby the house cat. He was Barnaby the adventurer, a seasoned traveler with stories to tell.\n\nHe found his way back to the familiar streets, the familiar scent of his house filling his nose. As he slipped through the cat flap, his humans greeted him with relief and affection. Barnaby purred, a contented rumble in his chest.
